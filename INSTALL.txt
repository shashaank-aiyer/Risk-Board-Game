Our project is the game of Risk. 
To run the code, in terminal type "make play"
If this doesn't work, type "dune build" and then try "make play" again
(Feel free to try to break our program, we ideally have covered
every possible user input error)

Additionaly for MS2, we began work on our gui. That is another folder in our zip file labeled
RiskGUI, this is a java project, 
usingg IntelliJ, open the java project with gradle. You should be able to run that in 
gradle by clicking the "gradle" icon on the sidebar of the left of the screen, from there click 
RiskGUI -> Tasks -> application -> run. This will display the current state of our GUI. 

There is additional code we have written but currently have no good way for you to demo it, as 
we have been testing it in utop right now. This code is capabale of communicating information 
between the OCaml program and the Java gui via sockets. 


When the game begins, you will have to set up the board
your first command will have to be 

    Player Amount num

where num is the number of players playing from 2-6

From there add your players one by one by doing 

    Add name

(If you would like to insert a first and last name, use an underscore
as such first_last)

From there, pick the countries you want when it is your turn using the command

    Pick country

(If the country name is multiple words, use an underscore,
 as such first_last) 

Then you can place your remaining troops as such, 

    Place num country

Where num is the number of troops you want to place and country is a country you own

Once all players have all troops placed, you may begin the actual game

At any point in the game you can call either of these commands: 

    Player Info player_name
    Country Info country_name

to get info about a specific player or country respectively

Also at any point you can call 

    Exit

to exit the game


In the placement phase of your turn, you can place your troops in a country you own via

    Place num country 

In the attack phase of your turn, you can attack a country with a country you own using

    Attack from towards

where "from" is the country you own, and "towards" is a country to attack. 
(You must have more than 1 troop in from to use it as an attacker)

If you win an attack you can move troops to the new location from your attack location via

    Move num

where "num" is the amount of troops you want to move

When you are done attacking, you can enter

    Continue

to continue

In the fortify phase, you can move troops from a country you own to another country you own via

  Fortify from towards num

or instead of fortifying you can just type
